title = OA-850 Liquid Fuel Booster
manufacturer = Orbitz Aerospace
description =  The OA-850 is an all in one rocket engine and fuel tank package. A product that is mostly a loss leader for Orbitz Aerospace since most of their sales are from the various parts required to maintain it given that it does not use standard parts and all parts are custom fitted to it. This forces engineers to purchase any parts and fittings directly from Orbitz.
Most Kerbal engineers prefer to pick and choose the components that make up a rocket or spacecraft. Unfortunately for the Kerbin Shuttle Orbiter consortium, Orbitz Aerospace was awarded the contract as they were the lowest bidder, cutting Rockomax, and Jebediah's Junkyard and Spaceship Parts Co. bid in half.
