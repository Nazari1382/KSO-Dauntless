title = Thrustmax External Fuel Tank
manufacturer = Thrustmax
description = Early in the Kerbin Shuttle program, engineers identified a need for an external fuel tank custom fitted to the orbiter. The Rockomax Conglomerate was the first choice, but do to delays in their material orders and having a backlog of Jumbo fuel tanks to fill, it was apparent that a custom fitted external fuel tank would not be manufactured in time for the KSO's first flight schedules.
The contract was instead awarded to Thrustmax Inc. who reverse engineered a Rockomax Jumbo-64 tank and came up with the design by welding two of them together. The result required the addition of external fuel lines and a custom fitted mounting frame specifically tailored to the Kerbin Shuttle Orbiter.
